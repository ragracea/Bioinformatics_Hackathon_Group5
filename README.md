# Task A. Connect with your team.

Group Members: Emily Bernabe, Taylor Nutzman, Zoe Vickery, Rachel Anderson, and Julia Bertarelli

# Task B. Select a disease to study.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition that affects red blood cells. Symptoms, diagnosis, treatment

# Task C. Find a gene underlying the disease.

The underlying cause of sickle cell disease is a single mutation in the β-globin gene (HBB). The mutation is a single nucleotide change, GAG to GTG, in the sixth codon of this gene. This mutation results in an amino acid change from glutamic acid to valine, which results in the production of hemoglobin S (HbS). The HBB gene is located on chromosome 11 and codes for the β-globin protein, which is an essential component of hemoglobin. In addition to HBB, other genes can modify the appearance and severity of SCD. Some of these genes include fetal hemoglobin (HbF) related genes like BCL11A, α-Thalassemia genes like HBA1 and HBA2, and inflammatory and adhesion molecule genes like VCAM1 and IL-4.

# Task D. Build a protein:protein interaction (PPI) network using the known gene protein product(s) as seeds.

# Task E. Find tissue-specific eQTLs DNA polymorphisms that could alter the expression of the candidate genes.

# Task F. Construct an hypothesis that the genes caused the disease phenotype by mechanism X.
The sickle cell anemia phenotype is caused by a cascade of molecular events initiated by the HBB gene mutation, leading to altered red blood cell membrane properties and increased cellular adhesion, ultimately resulting in vaso-occlusion and tissue damage.
